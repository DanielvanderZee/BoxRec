# Boxrec
This repository provides a very simple Python wrapper around the Boxrec.com website. The goal is to provide an easy way to access the information presented on the Boxrec website without having to go through the whole DOM-tree yourself.

# How do I use this?
To be added in the near Future :wink:

# Why is this repository so nicely structured / extremely verbose (take your pick!)
My goal is to also use this repository for the testing course in the masterclass. Therefore, it is structured in a way that will facilitate myself explaining about dependency injection/factory patterns etc. The consequence of this is that the code is slightly verbose...
